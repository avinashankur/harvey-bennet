          I’m Spencer Sharp. I live in New York City, where I design the future.

          I’ve loved making things for as long as I can remember, and wrote my
          first program when I was 6 years old, just two weeks after my mom
          brought home the brand new Macintosh LC 550 that I taught myself to
          type on.

          The only thing I loved more than computers as a kid was space. When I
          was 8, I climbed the 40-foot oak tree at the back of our yard while
          wearing my older sister’s motorcycle helmet, counted down from three,
          and jumped — hoping the tree was tall enough that with just a bit of
          momentum I’d be able to get to orbit.
        </p>

          I spent the next few summers indoors working on a rocket design, while
          I recovered from the multiple surgeries it took to fix my badly broken
          legs. It took nine iterations, but when I was 15 I sent my dad’s
          Blackberry into orbit and was able to transmit a photo back down to
          our family computer from space.

          Today, I’m the founder of Planetaria, where we’re working on civilian
          space suits and manned shuttle kits you can assemble at home so that
          the next generation of kids really can make it to orbit — from the
          comfort of their own backyards.
